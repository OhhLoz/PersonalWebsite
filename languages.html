                    <p>My experience of C++ is a fairly recent one, after gaining experience using C & C# previously (through Asteroids / A Levels with C# and C in first year of University), C++ was featured prominently in one of the modules. It was used as a comparison tool to C & Java, this was used to reinforce foundations with these from first year & the first semester of the second year. After using it for these it has become one of my main languages, due to its widespread use and extensive support. I'm currently using it for my Rocksmith Discord Rich Presence project.</p>

                    <p>I really like Java, it has extensive use in my University course much like C++ & C did. I used it widely for coursework & am currently using it to develop an Android application (It was also useful during a Mobile Device Programming module). This helps to reinforce Object Oriented principles that I feel may be more easily lost by using other languages.</p>

                    <p>I learned the fundamentals of C in my first year of university, we had many courseworks and exercises which used a lot of the important features that every programmer should know in my opinion (Recursion, Memory Allocation & Pointers) I also like how the use of C led to the foundations of learning C++ & Java and made the whole process far easier.</p>

                    <p>I've always been interested how websites were made up using HTML, and that you could see any websites HTML from any browser. I had always wanted to make a website to use HTML (Along with CSS & JS) but other projects got in the way. In my first year of university we had to use HTML, PHP & MySQL to create a website to handle music libraries and sort artists. In second year I became a bit more familiar with it when it was used during a group project for a demonstratable we were developing to demonstrate our algorithm. In the end it looked very nice thanks to the CSS and worked smoothly because of the javascript frontend and PHP backend. Of course the website you are reading this on was made using HTML.</p>

                    <p>I used to use PHP exclusively to connect to the front end of a website, as I was not aware that JavaScript could probably handle what I wanted to do perfectly well. I would have used PHP for this website had I not been forced to use JavaScript by GitHub. This was not a bad thing however since I had no prior experience with JS and was eager to learn. I had used PHP for many algorithms and backend coding to connect to the front end of a website, such as the first year project mentioned in the HTML section or the second year project for the KMeans Clustering Algorithm.</p>

                    <p>C# was the programming language I learned during my A-Levels (Alongside a bit of PASCAL), and I found that it was the first programming language I was serious in using and learning. I used it alongside a group of friends for my Ludum Dare project in 2015 using the MonoGame C# framework. More recently, it has found use in Udemy courses and Games modules both revolving around its use within the Unity Game Engine which helped me brush up on my skills with it.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is both an interesting and confusing language to me, namely the declaration of variables through the execution context. I have tried to become more familiar with this language, currently through the development of a Discord bot to Link with a website called HLTV.org for the Videogame Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I've also used JavaScript in this website, I had dabbled with it in my second year project as it was needed there to give the HTML some dynamic/extra function.</p>

                    <p>Python (& Visual Basic) is where it all started for me, as I presume it would be for a lot of people as its quite a simple language to get your head around and can easily integrate and is quite versatile.

I like how its linked to the Lambda Calculus and is an important part of Computer Science thanks to Alonzo Church.</p>

                    <p>I have only learned of Kotlin through HackSoc at the University of Nottingham. They held a few workshops on the language and I found it quite interesting. The parallels to Java were helpful since I find Java quite a logical language that follows how I think about problems. The syntax is quite interesting as it seems like a mix of Haskell and Java, the leader of the workshop emphasised its versatility so I would be interesting in pursuing it further in the future.</p>
